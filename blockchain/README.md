# Blockchain: Hyperledger Fabric Deployer

This Blockchain module aims at automatically deploying a Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain. 
The number of organizations and peers can be automatically adjusted. 
By default, one single organization, one peer and a single orderer are considered. 

Along with the deployment, this module is used to implement an on-chain anonymous attribute verification. 
The code for this can be found in the method `verify` inside the `aav.go` chaincode
